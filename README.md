# Online / Offline Budget Tracker



## Description 
    
WorkoutTracker allows the user to continue a previous workout or create a new one.  After each exercise the tracker will show a summary for the workout. 

This application uses a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js, Express, a Mongo DB, and a mongoose package.

The user may enter any exercise to the tracker along with other details depending on the type of exercise. This adds the exercise to a Mongo database. 

With the given code looking through the public folder walking back through the exercises in day 2 made it obvious what was needed. A server.js, models, and routes.
